Project Title: Credit Card Usage Prediction Using Neural Networks

Overview:
This project involves building a neural network model to predict credit card usage based on
a dataset from a hypothetical bank. The primary goal is to illustrate the process of using a
simple neural network to analyze and predict consumer behavior regarding credit card
usage.

Problem Statement:
The dataset includes information on consumers' use of credit card facilities, including
variables such as the number of years a customer has been with the bank (Years), the
customer's salary (Salary), and whether the customer has left an unpaid credit card
balance at the end of at least one month in the prior year (Used Credit).
