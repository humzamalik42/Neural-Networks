Project: Cash Flow Analysis for Green Inc.

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive cash flow analysis for a development project at Green Inc. 

Using advanced Excel techniques such as NORM.INV() for probabilistic forecasting, NPV() for discounting cash flows, and Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment, I evaluated the financial viability of the project over a 10-year period. 

The project also includes data visualizations, such as scatter plots, to present the range of potential outcomes. This analysis provided key insights into profitability, risk management, and data-driven decision-making.
